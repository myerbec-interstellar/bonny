<h1><center>The Life of Anne Bonny</center></h1>

<h2><center>The Notorious Female Pirate</center></h2>
<hr>
<p><center>

Anne Bonny was an irish pirate active in the Caribbean during the early 1700's.</center></p>

 <p><center>Anne Bonny was born in Ireland on March 8th 1697, and disappeared in April of 1721.</center></p>

 <p><center>
   Anne married and took the name of sailor James Bonny. Her father disapproved of the marriage, and kicked her out. Afterwards, Anne and James moved to Nassau, to the Republic of Pirates.
   <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Pirates">The Republic of Pirates</a> acted as a safe haven for outlaws, whether they had a Kings pardon or were simply evading the law.

 </center></p>

 <p><center>
  Soon, though, James Bonny began reporting to the governor of the island, spying on the pirates and resulting in many of their arrests. Anne highly disapproved of her husbands choices.
 </center></p>

<p><center>She was known to be affiliated with other known pirates,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_Jack">"Calico" Jack Rackham</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Read">Mary Read</a>, who were all captured together in October of 1720. </center></p>

<p><center>
  While they were working together, Calico Jack had offered James Bonny money to divorce Anne, but when he refused and threatened them, Rackham and Bonny ran away together, and Bonny joined his crew.
  <br /> Bonny started disguising herself as a man to better fit into Rackhams crew, soon meeting Mary Read, who was doing the exact same thing.
</center></p>

<p><center>All three were sentenced to death upon captured, but the only sentence that followed through was Calico Jack's, as Read and Bonny could not be killed due to being pregnant.
  <br>Mary Read died in jail, though, of fever. Anne Bonny escaped and was never found.</center></p>
